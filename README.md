# The-ToyVerse-Project - Assignment 11

* If someone visit the website, he can just see the blogs and the alltoys section. So that he can get a good idea of the website and the products.
* No one can view the details of any specific products without logging in. The user must have to create and account or login if he/she has already registered before.
* The sellers can add toys on their own account. My toys section is for the seller. If the seller gets in to the website, he can see the products he has added.
* The edit option also is useful. If someone puts any wrong information about the product, he can just check it up and change it in a minute.
* The delete button help to remove any item that is no longer needed for the website. There is a confirmation box that will appear before deleting the item and it will have two buttons asking if the person want to confirm the delete or not.
* The home page is fully responsive.
* Each and all the small details are added to the website, so that the user experience gets better and smooth.
